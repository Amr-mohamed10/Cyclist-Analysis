## Documentation

### __This case is divided into 2 sections:__

1. The data preparation/processing/analysis phases are done via Rstudio (using Tivdyverse packages).   

2. The data visualization is done via [**Tableau**](https://public.tableau.com/shared/8JY6YZGRC?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

### About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.


## Business Objective 
- What is the problem?
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
- How can Cyclists use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
- How can your insights drive business decisions?

## Data
_The data is on an AWS server where it is easily downloadable and named correctly. I downloaded the previous 12 months data and stored it locally for the next steps in the analysis processes. It is organized by year and Fiscal Quarters. The data is reliable and original since it comes from the company.It is comprehensive, current, and cited. The data source is the company so everything about the users personal information is hidden or kept private to the company only._


## Process 

_Tools: Excel, and R Studio The data comes from the company so it is trustworthy and has integrity. I’ve used R Studio to make a markdown report where I ensure the data is clean, and follows consistent standards by renaming incorrect columns and eliminating unnecessary columns._
